Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================
 
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.
 
The dataset being used is ```Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones DataSet``` and is available at following site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 
 
 
## Files
 
`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean the data.
 
`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. It can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
 
`tidy_data.txt` a tidy dataset created using dataset from step 4 as input, and uploaded in the course project's directory.
 
Note – Prerequisite to execute code script (`run_analysis.R`) is that the data should be present in the folder (`UCI HAR Dataset`) under user’s R working directory, un-compressed and without names altered.
